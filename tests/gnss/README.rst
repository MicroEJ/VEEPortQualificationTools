MicroEJ GNSS Validation
==============================

Overview
--------

This project contains test cases aimed at validating the correct runtime execution 
of the GNSS Pack on a MicroEJ Platform connected to a Board Support Package (BSP).
 
Tests are written as JUnit test cases, thus the main entry point is automatically generated by the MicroEJ SDK.

Tests can be launched:

-  as a standard Application by using a local launcher.
-  as a Platform Test Suite by building the module.

Requirements
------------

-  See Platform Test Suites `documentation <../README.rst>`_.

Usage
-----

Platform Test Suite Mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  In MicroEJ SDK, import the ``java-testsuite-runner-gnss`` project in your workspace.

-  Follow the configuration and execution steps described in Platform Test Suites `documentation <https://docs.microej.com/en/latest/Tutorials/tutorialRunATestSuiteOnDevice.html>`_.
